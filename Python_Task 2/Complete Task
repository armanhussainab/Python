2) Explanation of all the features:


Cement (Component 1)
* The mean and median are similar, meaning the data is balanced.
* The values are spread out moderately around the average.
* The distribution is symmetrical and close to normal.
Blast Furnace Slag (Component 2)
* The mean is higher than the median, showing a right-skewed (positively skewed) distribution.
* The data points are widely spread.
* The distribution has a heavier tail on the right.
Fly Ash (Component 3)
* The mean and median are close, showing a balanced distribution.
* The data points stay close to the average.
* The distribution is symmetrical and normal.
Water (Component 4)
* The mean and median are similar, meaning the data is balanced.
* The values are moderately spread out around the average.
* The distribution is symmetrical and normal.
Superplasticizer (Component 5)
* The mean is higher than the median, showing a right-skewed distribution.
* The data points are widely spread.
* The distribution has a heavier tail on the right.
Coarse Aggregate (Component 6)
* The mean and median are similar, meaning the data is balanced.
* The values are moderately spread out.
* The distribution is symmetrical and normal.
Fine Aggregate (Component 7)
* The mean and median are similar, showing a balanced distribution.

Explanation of all diagrams:
Histogram
* Cement, Water, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate: These features show a roughly normal distribution, with most data points clustered around the mean.
* Blast Furnace Slag, Superplasticizer, Age: These features show a right-skewed distribution, with a long tail on the right side.
* Concrete compressive strength: This feature shows a roughly normal distribution, with most data points clustered around the mean.


Scatterplots: 
* Cement vs Concrete Compressive Strength: There is a positive correlation between cement content and concrete compressive strength.


Boxplots:
* Concrete Compressive Strength: The boxplot shows a symmetric distribution with a few outliers on the higher end.
