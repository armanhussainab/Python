Part 1: Simple Random Sampling 
a. Take two columns, “wip” and “over_time”. Create two samples of 20 values each for both columns.
Name them “wip_sample_1”, “wip_sample_2”, “over_time_sample_1”, “over_time_sample_2”.
There will be 4 samples with in total 80 values. Find the following information of all the samples:
Mean, Median, Mode, Range, Variance, Standard deviation, Inter-quartile range, skewness and
kurtosis.
Bonus point: If you use for loop to obtain all the values.
b. Compare the measurements of two samples of “wip”. What type of difference you see between
these two samples? Are the measurements same for two samples? If not, then explain their data
distributions.
c. Repeat the task “b” for two samples of “over_time”, do the same analysis.

Part 2: Stratified Random Sampling 
a. As you can see, there are four quarters in the column “quarter”. Use stratified random sampling
and create a sample of 100 values where 25% of all the samples must come from each quarter.
b. As you can see, garments worker work from Saturday to Thursday, 6 days. Use stratified random
sampling and create a sample of 60 values where exactly 10 values must come from each day.

Part 3: Linear systematic sampling 
a. Similar to part 1 of the task list, take two columns, “wip” and “over_time”. Create two samples of
20 values each for both columns. Name them “wip_sys_sample_1”, “wip_sys_sample_2”,
“over_time_sys_sample_1”, “over_time_sys_sample_2” by using Linear systematic sampling.
b. Find the following information of all the samples:
Mean, Median, Mode, Range, Variance, Standard deviation, Inter-quartile range, skewness and
kurtosis.
c. Compare the measurements of two samples of “wip”. What type of difference you see between
these two samples? Are the measurements same for two samples? If not, then explain their data
distributions.
d. Repeat the task “c” for two samples of “over_time”, do the same analysis.
e. Now the fun part, after using both sampling method (Simple random sampling and Linear
systematic sampling) on the same data (wip and over_time), which sampling method do you
prefer? And why?
